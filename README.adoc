= SSLbrick

SSL WEBrick handler, modified copy of the standard WEBrick handler with options to force SSL
Needed because rails s does not parse and pass the option to enable ssl.
And if it did the standard handler does not include the right library for ssl.


= How To Use

Add `gem 'sslbrick', git: 'https://github.com/ogd-software/SSLbrick.git'` to Gemfile.

Install with `bundle install`.
