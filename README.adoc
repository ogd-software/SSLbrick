= SSLbrick

SSL WEBrick handler, modified copy of the standard WEBrick handler with options to force SSL.
Needed because `rails server` does not parse and pass the option to enable SSL.
(And if it did, the standard handler does not include the right library for SSL.)

= How To Use

Add `gem 'sslbrick', git: 'https://github.com/ogd-software/SSLbrick.git'` to your Gemfile.

Install with `bundle install`.
