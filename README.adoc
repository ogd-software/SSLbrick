= SSLbrick

SSL WEBrick handler, modified copy of the standard WEBrick handler with options to force SSL.
Needed because `rails server` does not parse and pass the option to enable SSL.
(And if it did, the standard handler does not include the right library for SSL.)

= How To Use

Add `gem 'sslbrick', git: 'https://github.com/ogd-software/SSLbrick.git',
branch: 'release-1.0'` to your Gemfile and install with `bundle install`.

= Development

Backwards *compatible* changes to SSLbrick should be merged into the most
recent release branch. Backwards *incompatible* changes to SSLbrick should be
pushed onto a new release branch. This way, we can easily update SSLbrick
without breaking.
